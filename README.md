Updated: 07/05/2015

This is a repository for all of my rootkit/driver development experiments.

sources:

	Contains all of the files used by Visual Studio 2013 Professional.

binaries:

	Contains compiled executables and drivers.

	hello_world:

		Nothing too useful, this folder just contains the first few drivers I ever wrote.

	basic_driver:

		A pretty straightforward driver designed to be used as a skeleton for further development.

		Showcases driver basics like loading and unloading, handing different kinds of IRP's (including IOCTL's)
		etc.
